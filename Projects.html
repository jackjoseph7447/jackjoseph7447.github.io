        <p><h3>Capstone Project</h3>
            This was something that I did my senior year of college with a team of students to help our client, which was Temple University. We do not
            have access to the actual project to itself anymore due to limited access, but this book shows how it was supposed to work and the processes
            along the way. It was a very fun project that taught me how to work as a team and with any potential clients.
            You can download that book <a href="book/FinalBook.pdf" download="FinalBook.pdf">here</a><br/><br/>
            <h3>Final Grade Calculator</h3>
            <img id="FGCImages" src="images/MainScreen.png"/>
            <img id="FGCImages" src="images/Tutorial.png"/> <br/>
            With this application, students were able to find the grades needed to pass a class.
            The first image (The first image) is the main screen of the application.
            The second image (The second image) displays a quick tutorial about how to use the app and what everything means. 
            If you would like to view the repository for the project, click <a href="https://github.com/jackjoseph7447/FinalGradeApp">here</a>.
            I believe the app store does not support the app unfortantly, but if a device has the app already, it works still. <br/>

            <h3>Resturant Review</h3>
            <img id="DefaultImg" src="images/RestHP.png"/> <br />
            This was part of a class I had in college. It was a group project, and my partner and I worked very hard on it.
            It is a site similar to how Yelp works. To use the application and test it out, press <a href="https://cis-iis2.temple.edu/Fall2023/CIS3342_tul42951/TermProjectWS/">here</a>.

            <h3>Python Learning Course</h3>
            <img id="DefaultImg" src="images/PythonCourse.png"/> <br />
            This is a learning tool I am using to teach myself Python. None of the courses I have taken
            actually teach Python, so I found a course that will help with that on github. I think This
            is a great way to learn a language to help with my coding education. You can find my progress <a href="https://github.com/jackjoseph7447/30-Days-Of-Python-Solutions">here</a>.
