        <h2>Mobile Apps Development</h2>
        <p>
            In this class, we will learn about how create applications for the Andriod OS using Kotlin,
            a very new language. Kotlin is based of Java, and is only 11 years old. I am enjoying learning
            the differences between Kotlin and C# and even Java as it has some good short cuts when it customers
            to object-oriented programming.

        <h2>Securing the Internet of Things</h2>
        <p>
            Many things are all being connected more than ever, which is what this class is about.
            One of our early lessons was about how we could secure a stop light not only from online
            attacks, but also a physical attack. We will also discuss cloud securing and other related
            topics. We even get an understand of how these systems work to get a better understanding of 
            how securing them could work. I enjoy this class as someone who is looking to get 
            into the cyber security space.

        <h2>Current Topics in Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Because of AI, more people have their eyes on the technology world now more than ever.
            This class allows use to pick a topic relating to AI and see how it effects things.
            I have picked how deep fakes can effect a political campaign or election. Being in the 
            space, I am aware of AI and how great it can be, but also cauious of how dangerous it can be.
            This class will allow students to take a deeper look into how AI can effect aspects of everyday
            life.

        <h2>Hack the Box</h2>
        <p>
            This is a website that can be used to help learn about hacking. Since I want to be in this field,
            I thought it would be use that I also know how to hack. It creates a seperate enviroment so you can
            practice using linux commands that are useful for hacking, such as nmap and ftp. Since it is free,
            I can do some of the basic lessons and build off that. Since knowing how this would system can be hacked,
            knowing what the attacker is doing is very helpful for someone defending systems.
